**Andrew Clay Shafer** ([@littleidea](http://twitter.com/littleidea)).

Coming to you live from [DevOpsDays Minneapolis](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-minneapolis/), Matt and Bridget sit down with Andrew Clay Shafer in front of a live audience, to talk about _____ (after a brief detour on why episode numbers on podcasts are obnoxious, and why sushi with Andrew is an interesting experience).

Don't know who Andrew is? He suggests you [Google him](https://www.google.com/search?q=andrew+clay+shafer&oq=andrew+clay+shafer&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2j69i61j0l2.2642j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8), but then goes on to give a little bit of his background: he's been involved in software development and technology for almost 20 years. After rooming with Luke Kanies in college, Andrew got interested in operations and system administration.

O'Reilly's Velocity Conference was influential as well, and Andrew reiminisces about his presentation on [Agile Infrastructure](http://www.slideshare.net/littleidea/agile-infrastructure-velocity-09). John Willis speaks up from the audience, and strongly suggests going to look at the slides.
